    <h2>What is Compute Job Recorder? </h2>
    <p>
        Compute Job Recorder is a light weight tool, written in python for recording the start, end and progress of
        tasks in a generic database sqlite structure.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Compute Job Recorder? </h2>
    <p>
        Do you process many input files producing many output files. How to do you know that all your jobs have
        completed? For me, I end up grepping log file for the would 'error', although if I do find something find
        which file it is associated with can be difficult. Alternatively, I find out something went wrong only
        when I come to merge the results product files to find some are missing.
    </p>

    <p>
        This can end up wasting a lot of time and effort sorting out problems which would have been easier to
        sort out when your were undertaking that processing step.
    </p>

    <p>
        Compute Job Recorder aims to solve this issue by recording the start, end and progress of tasks in a generic
        database structure with a small overhead. However, it is not recommended that you put Compute Job Recorder
        function calls within a loop, it is intended to be used sparsely within your system.
    </p>

    <h2>How do I use Compute Job Recorder?</h2>
    <p>The first step is to set an environment <code>CJR_DB_FILE</code> so the database can be found during execution.</p>

    <pre>
        <code class="prettyprint">
export CJR_DB_FILE="/home/user/cjr_logging_db.sqlite"
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>Python</h3>
    <p>
        In python there is a single function you call. You just need to use the same job name (string),
        task ID (string) and version (int) for each call. You must call the function with a <code>START</code>
        status before <code>UPDATE</code> or <code>END</code> are used. The task information is provided as
        a python dictionary which is stored as a JSON string within the database.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code class="prettyprint">
from cjrlib.cjr_recorder import record_task_status, JobStatus

record_task_status(JobStatus.START, "Job1", "Tile1", 1, {'param1':param1_val, 'param2':param2_val})
# Doing some work
record_task_status(JobStatus.UPDATE, "Job1", "Tile1", 1, {'process':process_info, 'function':'doing_something()'})
# Continue doing some work
record_task_status(JobStatus.FINISH, "Job1", "Tile1", 1, {'output':output_file})
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>Shell Script</h3>
    <p>
        When using the command line tool you have the same interface as the python function but
        rather than provide a python dictionary you need to provide a JSON string with the extra information.
        You can use the python function and terminal command inter-changeably throughout your system.
        For example, <code>START</code> and <code>END</code> could be called from the terminal command
        and <code>UPDATE</code> coded within a python script.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code class="prettyprint">
cjr_record.py -s START -j Job1 -t Tile1 -v 1 -i "{'param1':1, 'param2':22.2}"
# Doing some work
cjr_record.py -s UPDATE -j Job1 -t Tile1 -v 1 -i "{'cmd':'gdal_translate}"
# Continue doing some work
cjr_record.py -s FINISH -j Job1 -t Tile1 -v 1 -i "{'output':'output.kea'}"
        </code>
    </pre>
